# Connection
My code in the group project of CSE305. I am responsible for User and Manager features.
Programming tools used: Java, Java Servlet, Java Servlet Page, Java Standard Tag Library, and MySQL.
Features implemented:
  1. User registration, log in and log out.
  2. User view personal page and post on it.
  3. User add friends, send messages and receive messages from them.
  4. View reports from database for manager.
  5. Modify information in database from a manager page.
 
Flaws:
  1. Style was not a grading component, so pages look ugly.
  2. Having more than 1 servlets is tedious when each page is forward by a different Servlet. It can be done by 1 Servlet checking the path.
  3. It was a relatively short project, it is not Facebook. There is no messages in messages and likes features.
